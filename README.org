* jlox

A Lox implementation in Java.

This implementation was created by following the book [[https://craftinginterpreters.com/][Crafting Interpreters]]. It
does not deviate from the implementation shown in the book, except I used some
modern Java features instead of the Java 8 style from the book.

** Usage

Please refer to and use the Makefile.
